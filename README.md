## Description

**This project creates BIT-flip attack against binarised weight of deep neural network and other machine learning models with minimum vulnerable BITs.** 


This project was supported by the University of Hong Kong, EEE. \
Currently restricted to internal usage only.

## Usage

There are 3 attack methods in this repository and some pretrained binary weight models over NMNIST and MNIST.

1. Random Flipping Attack:

```
Usage: command [options] [arguments]
```

2. FGSM-based weight Attack:

```
Usage: command [options] [arguments]
```

3. Genetic Algorithm weight Attack:

```
Usage: command [options] [arguments]
```
