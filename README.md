## Project Description

The project creates BIT-flip attack over binarised weight of deep \
neural network and other machine learning models. 


This project was supported by the University of Hong Kong, EEE. \
Currently solely for internal usage.

## Usage

There are 3 attack methods in this repository and some pretrained binary models using NMNIST and MNIST.

1. Random Flipping Attack:

```
Usage: command [options] [arguments]
```

2. FGSM-based weight Attack:

```
Usage: command [options] [arguments]
```

3. Genetic Algorithm weight Attack:

```
Usage: command [options] [arguments]
```
